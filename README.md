# My TeamTalk Python Bot Project! (with AI)
Alright, finally getting this TeamTalk bot project onto GitHub!

This is the first commit, putting up the whole script (v2.4) as it is right now. Been working on this for a bit, using AI to help figure out the tricky parts like the wxPython GUI and all the different features.

It's designed for TeamTalk 5 and includes stuff like:
*   A GUI for logs and basic controls
*   Gemini AI commands (needs an API key in config.ini)
*   Weather commands (needs an API key too)
*   Polls and word filtering
*   Lots of admin commands
*   Auto-reconnect logic

Basically, everything in the NewTeamTalkBot.py file.

Hope someone finds this cool or useful! You'll need `requests`, `google-generativeai`, and `wxPython` installed (`pip install ...`) if you wanna run it.

Let's see how this GitHub thing goes! :)
